# Singaporean Restaurants - Recommender System
This repository contains the code for a fun project used to learn about web scraping and recommender systems as part of the free-choice assignment for the Data Science and Business Applications course at CBS.
In this project, I built a web scraper that autonomously collects Google reviews data of Singaporean restaurants (because Singapore happens to be one of the best cities for foodies in my opinion) and then applied basic collaborative filtering techniques to make a simple restaurant recommender system.
